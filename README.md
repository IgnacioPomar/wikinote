## WikiNote

**WikiNote** is a personal knowledge management system designed to organize information in a structured, secure, and durable way.

It follows a wiki-inspired approach, allowing content to be interconnected through links and organized using hierarchical categories, while remaining simple to write and maintain through Markdown.

### Goals

WikiNote is built to:

- organize personal knowledge in a structured and navigable form  
- connect ideas using wiki-style links  
- classify content through hierarchical categories  
- manage multimedia attachments securely  
- share selected content with different groups using fine-grained access control  
- ensure privacy and secure access to information  
- maintain versioned and traceable content over time  

### Philosophy

WikiNote adopts a **wiki-first** model where knowledge evolves organically through connections and structure. It combines the clarity and longevity of wiki systems with modern requirements such as security, controlled sharing, and extensibility.

### Security & Access Control

From the ground up, WikiNote includes:

- category-based permission inheritance  
- note-level exceptions and explicit deny rules  
- secure attachment access tied to visible content  
- group-based sharing with strict privacy guarantees  

### Extensibility

WikiNote is designed to support extensions that can process content, generate derived views, build graphs, or create domain-specific visualizations without compromising the core security model.

### Inspiration

WikiNote draws inspiration from classic wiki engines and interconnected knowledge systems, adapted for a modern personal environment where structure, security, and long-term accessibility are essential.
